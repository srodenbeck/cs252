# React-Flask
Following a tutorial, I created a basic AJAXy filter component that searches and changes the DOM/view live.

The backend is boilerplate flask application that renders template. Here however, we serve most of the page using React. This has some interesting implications. I am planning to run this in future projects.

## Running
1. Clone the repo
2. Create virtual env and source it using `source env/bin/activate` (OSX.
3. Run `[sudo] pip install -r requirements.txt` or 'pip install flask'
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `bower install`
6. Run `python project/app.py` or `sh run.sh` to run the application
7. Visit `localhost:5000` to see the application
